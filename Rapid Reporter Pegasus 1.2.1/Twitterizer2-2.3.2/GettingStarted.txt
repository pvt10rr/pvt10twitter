Q) Which files do I need?
A) More than likely, you only need Twitterizer2.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll

Q) What exactly are all these files?
A)
	Twitterizer2.dll
		This is the main binary which contains the core class library. This file is required for all addon 
		libraries.

	Twitterizer2.Data.dll
		This is an additional library that provides data conversion functionality. 
		For example, with it you can quickly generate DataTables from any Twitterizer2 collection.
		This file is not necessary for most projects.

	Newtonsoft.Json.dll
		This is JSON.NET, developed by James Newton-King. You do not need to add a reference in your 
		project to this library, but it must be placed in your project's bin folder along with Twitterizer2.dll.
		More information can be found here: http://james.newtonking.com/pages/json-net.aspx

	Twitterizer2.Async.dll
		This is an addon library that allows developers to call Twitterizer2 methods asynchronously.
		This file is not necessary for most projects.

	Twitterizer2.Streaming.dll
		This is an addon library that provides access to the Streaming API.
		This file is not necessary for most projects.

	Twitterizer.OAuth.dll
		This is a standalone library that provides access to our OAuth request signing functionality without 
		using Twitterizer2. _DO_NOT_ include this file in your project if you are using Twitterizer2.dll. 
		All of the functionality found in this library is available within Twitterizer2.dll.
		This file is not necessary for most projects.

	Twitterizer2lite.dll
		This is a slimmed down version of the Twitterizer2.dll file built with the client profile as the target framework.
		It will lack some extra pieces of functionality, such as the built-in data caching and support for application 
		configuration settings.
		_DO_NOT_ include this file in your project if you are using Twitterizer2.dll. 
		This file is not necessary for most projects.

Q) What about the license files?
A) The license files must accompany the dlls. That means that they must be distributed along with your application.
